    <p style="font-size: x-large; color: darkslategray; border: 8px double black;" co >Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani female education activist and the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate at the age of 17.
         She is the world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, the second Pakistani and the first Pashtun to receive a Nobel Prize.
          Yousafzai is a human rights advocate for the education of women and children in her native homeland, Swat, where the Pakistani Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school.
           Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become Pakistan's "most prominent citizen."
           “We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.”
           “One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world.”
           “When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.”
           “Education is education. We should learn everything and then choose which path to follow.”
           “Let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons.”
           “Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrow's reality.”
           “We should all consider each other as human beings, and we should respect each other.”</p></center>
